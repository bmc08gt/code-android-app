# Code Android App

[Code](https://getcode.com) is a mobile wallet app leveraging self-custodial blockchain technology to deliver an instant, global, and private payments experience. 

Code is currently live on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/code-wallet/id1562384846). 

Android is still a work in progress. The foundation is in place but there are several known issues impacting stability and performance, and is not yet at feature parity with iOS.
