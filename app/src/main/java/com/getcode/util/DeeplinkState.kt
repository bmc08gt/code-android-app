/**
 * This class is used to manage intent state across navigation.
 *
 * This hack is in place because determining the users authenticated
 * state takes a long time. The app will try to handle incoming intents
 * before the authentication state is determined.
 * This class caches the incoming deeplink intent so the navigation controller
 * does not override the intent sent by handleDeepLink(intent) in the main activity.
 *
 * If this was not in place the app would try to handle the deeplink before the
 * authentication state is complete and override navigation - dropping the intent
 * in favour of the lastest request in the navigation graph.
